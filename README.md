# Detecting unreliable workers

1. Create three directories:
- `training_data` for storing all the files used for training (`.csv`)
- `test_data` for storing all the files used for test (`.csv`)
- `predictions` in which the file with the predictions will be stored

2. Run `python second_cluster_people_tagged_nn.py`

3. `second_cluster_people_tagged_nn_simulation.py` is for simulating different activation functions.
